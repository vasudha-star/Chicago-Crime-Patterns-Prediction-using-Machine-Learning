# Chicago-Crime-Patterns-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
Machine learning analysis of Chicago crime data for arrest prediction and hotspot detection using Random Forest, Decision Tree, K-Means, and other advanced models.

This project analyzes the Chicago Crime Dataset to uncover spatial, temporal, and categorical crime patterns and predict the likelihood of arrests using supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques.

Supervised Learning: Implemented models such as Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, KNN, Naive Bayes, and SVM for arrest prediction. Applied SMOTE to handle class imbalance, improving recall for minority cases.

Unsupervised Learning: Used K-Means, DBSCAN, and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) to detect potential crime hotspots, leveraging PCA for dimensionality reduction.

Key Insights: Crimes like gambling, prostitution, and narcotics show the highest arrest rates. K-Means achieved the highest silhouette score (0.3949), while Random Forest delivered the best classification performance.

Tools & Libraries: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, Google Colab.

Outcome:
The project provides data-driven insights for law enforcement, highlighting high-risk crime areas, peak crime times, and predictive models to assist in decision-making for public safety strategies.
